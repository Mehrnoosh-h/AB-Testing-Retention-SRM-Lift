    "In practical terms, moving the gate to level 40 corresponds to about 590 fewer Day-1 retained players per 100,000 installs and about 820 fewer Day-7 retained players per 100,000 installs, based on the observed absolute lifts (−0.59% for Day-1 and −0.82% for Day-7). When we account for testing two retention metrics using a Holm multiple-testing correction, the Day-1 result remains not statistically significant (adjusted p ≈ 0.074 → we can’t confidently say Day-1 retention changed), while the Day-7 drop remains statistically significant (adjusted p ≈ 0.0031), reinforcing the conclusion that the gate move to level 40 likely reduces week-1 retention by a small but meaningful amount."
